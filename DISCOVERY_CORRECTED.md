# ðŸŽ¯ REPOSITORY DISCOVERY - CORRECTED!

## User's Actual Setup
- **Repository Location**: C:\Users\malak\Desktop\Mala
- **Structure**: Repository IS the Mala folder (not a subfolder)
- **Status**: User already has the repo cloned locally

## What Happened
- I incorrectly assumed there was a MalaBoT subfolder
- User is actually IN the correct repository directory
- User just needs to pull the latest changes I made

## Next Steps for User
1. Run: git pull origin main
2. Verify: git status && git log --oneline -5
3. Test dev.bat git operations

## Files That Will Be Added
- TODO.md
- GIT_TROUBLESHOOTING.md 
- CURRENT_STATUS.md
- CLARIFICATION_NEEDED.md
- DISCOVERY_CORRECTED.md
- Fixed cogs/verify.py

All confusion resolved!
