# Test File for Git Pull Verification

This file is created to test that dev.bat Option 14 now shows detailed git pull output.

When you pull this change, you should see:
- File name: TEST_VERIFICATION.md
- Lines added: indicated with `+` symbols
- Detailed diff output

This confirms the fix is working correctly!
