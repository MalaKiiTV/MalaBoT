# üöÄ Deployment Instructions - IMPORTANT

## Current Status
‚úÖ All changes committed and pushed to `main` branch
‚úÖ All extra branches deleted (only `main` remains)
‚úÖ Code is ready for deployment

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: You Must Restart the Bot

The changes are in the code but **your bot is still running the old version**. You need to:

### Step 1: Pull Latest Changes
```bash
cd MalaBoT
git pull origin main
```

### Step 2: Restart Bot Using dev.bat
1. **Stop the bot** (dev.bat Option 2)
2. **Clear commands** (dev.bat Option 20) - This is IMPORTANT!
3. **Start the bot** (dev.bat Option 1)
4. **Wait 30 seconds** for commands to sync
5. **Restart Discord** (Ctrl+R) to clear client cache

### Step 3: Verify Changes
After restarting, check that:
- [ ] `/verify submit` platform dropdown shows ONLY: Xbox, PlayStation, Steam
- [ ] All moderation commands say "Mod only" not "Admin only"
- [ ] All XP commands say "Mod only" not "Administrator only"
- [ ] `/verify review` says "mod only" not "staff only"
- [ ] `/appeal review` says "mod only" not "staff only"
- [ ] `/setup` says "owner only"
- [ ] `/welcome` says "Owner only"

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Command Descriptions ‚úÖ
**Before:**
- Moderation commands: "Admin only"
- XP commands: "Administrator only"
- Appeal review: "staff only"

**After:**
- Moderation commands: "Mod only"
- XP commands: "Mod only"
- Appeal review: "mod only"
- Setup/Welcome: "Owner only"

### 2. Platform Dropdown ‚úÖ
**Before:** Xbox, PlayStation, Steam, Battle.net, Other
**After:** Xbox, PlayStation, Steam (only 3 options)

### 3. Branch Cleanup ‚úÖ
**Before:** main, permission-system-restructure, improve-setup-interactive-config
**After:** main (only)

## Why You're Seeing Old Data

Discord caches commands on both:
1. **Server side** - Cleared by stopping bot and using dev.bat Option 20
2. **Client side** - Cleared by restarting Discord (Ctrl+R)

The bot also caches the command tree in memory, so you must restart it to load the new code.

## Files Modified in Latest Commit
- `cogs/moderation.py` - Changed "Admin only" to "Mod only" (5 commands)
- `cogs/xp.py` - Changed "Administrator only" to "Mod only" (5 commands)
- `cogs/welcome.py` - Changed "Admin only" to "Owner only" + permission check

## Previous Changes (Already in Main)
- Platform dropdown reduced to 3 options
- All "staff" references changed to "mod"
- Documentation cleanup (7 files removed)
- Permission system restructured (Owner/Mod/Public)

## Troubleshooting

### If platform dropdown still shows 5 options:
1. Make sure you pulled latest code: `git pull origin main`
2. Stop the bot completely
3. Clear commands (dev.bat Option 20)
4. Start the bot
5. Wait 30 seconds
6. Restart Discord

### If commands still say "Admin only":
1. Check you're on main branch: `git branch` (should show `* main`)
2. Check latest commit: `git log --oneline -1` (should show "Fix command descriptions")
3. Restart bot and clear commands
4. Restart Discord

### If changes don't appear:
- The bot must be restarted to load new code
- Commands must be cleared and resynced
- Discord client must be restarted to clear cache

## Summary
‚úÖ Code is fixed and pushed to main
‚úÖ Branches are cleaned up
‚è≥ **YOU MUST RESTART THE BOT** to see changes

**Next Action:** Follow Step 1-3 above to deploy the changes!
