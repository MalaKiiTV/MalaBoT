# Git Repository Troubleshooting Guide

## üö® ISSUE IDENTIFIED
You're running git commands from the wrong directory. You need to navigate to your MalaBoT repository first.

## üîß CORRECT COMMANDS TO RUN

### Step 1: Navigate to the correct directory
```bash
cd C:\Users\malak\Desktop\MalaBoT
```

### Step 2: Then run these commands (CORRECTED)
```bash
git status
git log --oneline -5
git pull origin main
```

## ‚ùå WHAT YOU DID WRONG
```bash
# WRONG - You tried to change to a path that doesn't exist
cd your/MalaBoT/directory

# WRONG - You ran git commands from outside the repo directory
git status                    # This worked by coincidence
git log --oneline -5         # FAILED - # was interpreted as a path
git pull origin main         # FAILED - Already up to date was interpreted as a refspec
```

## ‚úÖ EXPECTED OUTPUT
When you run the commands correctly, you should see:

### `git status`
```
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

### `git log --oneline -5`
```

   ```

## üìã IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE MalaBoT FOLDER

```bash
cd C:\Users\malak\Desktop
git clone https://github.com/MalaKiiTV/MalaBoT.git
cd MalaBoT
```

## üîÑ AFTER VERIFYING

Once you confirm your local repository is up to date, you can run:

```bash
dev.bat
```
