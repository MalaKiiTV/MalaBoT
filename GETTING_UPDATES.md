# üîÑ How to Get Updates from SuperNinja AI

## üìñ Understanding the Process

When I (SuperNinja AI) make fixes to your code:

1. ‚úÖ I modify files in a **sandbox environment** (not your computer)
2. ‚úÖ I commit the changes to **git**
3. ‚úÖ I push them to **your GitHub repository** (MalaKiiTV/MalaBoT)
4. ‚è≥ **YOU** need to pull them to **your local machine**

**Think of it like this:**
- GitHub = Cloud storage
- My fixes = Uploaded to cloud
- Your computer = Needs to download from cloud

---

## üéØ EXACT PROCESS TO FOLLOW

### **Step 1: Pull Updates from GitHub**

**Option A: Using dev.bat (Easiest)**
```
1. Run dev.bat
2. Choose option 14 (Pull from GitHub)
3. Wait for completion
```

**Option B: Using Command Line**
```bash
cd MalaBoT
git pull origin main
```

**What this does:**
- Downloads all my fixes from GitHub to your computer
- Updates your local files with the changes I made
- Merges any conflicts (usually automatic)

---

### **Step 2: Run the Fixes (If Needed)**

After pulling, you may need to run specific fixes:

**For Command Issues:**
```
dev.bat ‚Üí Option 22 (Clear All)
dev.bat ‚Üí Option 23 (Fix /verify)
dev.bat ‚Üí Option 1 (Start Bot)
```

**For General Updates:**
```
dev.bat ‚Üí Option 7 (Update Workflow)
# This does everything: Pull ‚Üí Install ‚Üí Restart ‚Üí Status
```

---

## üîÑ Complete Workflow Example

### **Scenario: I just fixed your bot and pushed to GitHub**

**What I did:**
```
‚úÖ Modified files in sandbox
‚úÖ Committed: git commit -m "Fixed XYZ"
‚úÖ Pushed: git push to GitHub
‚úÖ Told you: "Changes pushed to GitHub!"
```

**What YOU do:**
```
1. Open dev.bat
2. Choose option 14 (Pull from GitHub)
   - This downloads my fixes to your computer
3. If I created new scripts, run them:
   - Option 22 (Clear All) - if I fixed commands
   - Option 23 (Fix /verify) - if I fixed verify
4. Choose option 1 (Start Bot)
5. Test in Discord
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT RULES

### **ALWAYS Pull First!**
```
‚ùå WRONG:
   - Run script without pulling
   - Use dev.bat options without pulling
   - Assume files are updated

‚úÖ CORRECT:
   - dev.bat ‚Üí Option 14 (Pull)
   - Then run scripts/options
```

### **Check What Changed**
```
After pulling, check:
dev.bat ‚Üí Option 9 (Check Git Status)

This shows what files I updated
```

### **If Pull Fails**
```
Error: "Updates were rejected"
Solution:
1. dev.bat ‚Üí Option 10 (Stage All Changes)
2. dev.bat ‚Üí Option 11 (Commit Changes)
   - Message: "Save local changes"
3. dev.bat ‚Üí Option 14 (Pull from GitHub)
4. dev.bat ‚Üí Option 12 (Push to GitHub)
```
