# MalaBoT Code Audit Report
**Date:** 2025-10-30
**Auditor:** SuperNinja AI

## Executive Summary
Overall code quality is **GOOD** with some areas for improvement. No critical security issues found, but there are optimization opportunities and potential memory leaks to address.

---

## ✅ STRENGTHS

### 1. Architecture
- ✅ Clean cog-based structure
- ✅ Proper separation of concerns (database, utils, config, cogs)
- ✅ Consistent use of async/await patterns
- ✅ Good error handling with try/except blocks

### 2. Recent Improvements
- ✅ Processing locks prevent infinite loops (role_connections + verify)
- ✅ Parallel database queries with asyncio.gather (appeal.py)
- ✅ Screenshot file handling instead of expired CDN URLs
- ✅ Proper defer() usage to prevent interaction timeouts

### 3. Database Management
- ✅ Centralized DatabaseManager
- ✅ Proper connection handling with get_connection()
- ✅ Commits after database operations

---

## ⚠️ ISSUES FOUND

### 1. **MEMORY LEAK - pending_verifications** (Medium Priority)
**Location:** `cogs/verify.py` lines 51, 160-161

**Issue:**
```python
self.bot.pending_verifications[interaction.user.id] = {
    "activision_id": self.activision_id.value,
    "timestamp": datetime.now(),
}
```

**Problem:**
- Dictionary grows indefinitely if users don't complete verification
- No cleanup mechanism for abandoned verifications
- Could cause memory issues over time

**Recommendation:**
```python
# Add cleanup task in Verify cog __init__
@tasks.loop(hours=1)
async def cleanup_pending_verifications(self):
    """Remove pending verifications older than 1 hour"""
    now = datetime.now()
    to_remove = []
    for user_id, data in self.bot.pending_verifications.items():
        if (now - data["timestamp"]).total_seconds() > 3600:
            to_remove.append(user_id)
    for user_id in to_remove:
        del self.bot.pending_verifications[user_id]
```

---

### 2. **DATABASE CONNECTION NOT CLOSED** (Low Priority)
**Location:** Multiple files

**Issue:**
```python
conn = await db.get_connection()
await conn.execute(...)
await conn.commit()
# No conn.close()
```

**Problem:**
- Connections are not explicitly closed
- Relies on garbage collection
- Could lead to connection pool exhaustion

**Recommendation:**
```python
conn = await db.get_connection()
try:
    await conn.execute(...)
    await conn.commit()
finally:
    await conn.close()
```

---

### 3. **SCREENSHOT BYTES IN MEMORY** (Low Priority)
**Location:** `cogs/verify.py` lines 430-434

**Issue:**
```python
screenshot_bytes = await screenshot.read()
pending["screenshot_bytes"] = screenshot_bytes
```

**Problem:**
- Large images stored in memory
- Multiple pending verifications = high memory usage
- No size limit check

**Recommendation:**
```python
# Add file size check
if screenshot.size > 10 * 1024 * 1024:  # 10MB limit
    await message.reply("Screenshot too large. Max 10MB.")
    return

# Or save to disk instead of memory
screenshot_path = f"temp/screenshots/{user_id}_{timestamp}.png"
await screenshot.save(screenshot_path)
pending["screenshot_path"] = screenshot_path
```

---

### 4. **MISSING ERROR HANDLING** (Low Priority)
**Location:** `cogs/verify.py` line 443

**Issue:**
```python
try:
    await message.delete()
except Exception as e:
    log_system(f"Failed to delete screenshot message: {e}", level="warning")
```

**Problem:**
- Generic Exception catch is too broad
- Should catch specific Discord errors

**Recommendation:**
```python
try:
    await message.delete()
except discord.Forbidden:
    log_system(f"Missing permissions to delete message", level="warning")
except discord.NotFound:
    log_system(f"Message already deleted", level="debug")
except discord.HTTPException as e:
    log_system(f"Failed to delete message: {e}", level="warning")
```

---

### 5. **INTERACTION TIMEOUT ISSUES** (Medium Priority)
**Location:** Multiple commands

**Issue:**
- Commands still timing out despite defer() fixes
- Network latency between local PC and Discord API

**Problem:**
- `/verify activision` times out frequently
- `/appeal submit` times out frequently
- Affects user experience

**Recommendation:**
```python
# Add timeout handling and retry logic
async def send_modal_with_retry(interaction, modal, max_retries=2):
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            await interaction.response.send_modal(modal)
            return True
        except discord.NotFound:
            if attempt < max_retries - 1:
                await asyncio.sleep(1)
                continue
            return False
    return False
```

---

### 6. **NO RATE LIMIT HANDLING** (Low Priority)
**Location:** Role operations in verify.py

**Issue:**
```python
await member.add_roles(cheater_role, reason=...)
roles_to_remove = [...]
await member.remove_roles(*roles_to_remove, reason=...)
```

**Problem:**
- Multiple role operations in quick succession
- Can trigger Discord rate limits
- Already seeing rate limit warnings in logs

**Recommendation:**
```python
# Batch role operations
async def update_roles_safely(member, add_roles=None, remove_roles=None, reason=None):
    """Update roles with rate limit handling"""
    try:
        if add_roles and remove_roles:
            # Discord allows editing roles in one call
            new_roles = set(member.roles) - set(remove_roles)
            new_roles.update(add_roles)
            await member.edit(roles=list(new_roles), reason=reason)
        elif add_roles:
            await member.add_roles(*add_roles, reason=reason)
        elif remove_roles:
            await member.remove_roles(*remove_roles, reason=reason)
    except discord.HTTPException as e:
        if e.status == 429:  # Rate limited
            retry_after = e.retry_after
            await asyncio.sleep(retry_after)
            # Retry once
            await update_roles_safely(member, add_roles, remove_roles, reason)
```

---

### 7. **NOTES PARAMETER NOT WORKING** (High Priority)
**Location:** `cogs/verify.py` line 204

**Issue:**
```python
notes: typing.Optional[str] = None
```

**Problem:**
- Notes always show as None even when provided
- Discord not syncing command parameter updates
- Affects moderator workflow

**Recommendation:**
```python
# Force command re-sync
# User needs to:
1. Run /sync in Discord
2. Wait 5 minutes
3. Restart Discord client
4. Test again

# If still not working, try:
# Option 24 in dev.bat (Clear All commands)
```

## 🔍 CODE QUALITY METRICS

### File Sizes
- ✅ Most cogs under 500 lines (good)
- ⚠️ setup.py: 1536 lines (consider splitting)
- ⚠️ role_connection_ui.py: 819 lines (consider refactoring)

### Error Handling
- ✅ 97 try/except blocks across codebase
- ⚠️ Some use generic Exception (should be specific)

### Database Operations
- ✅ Consistent use of get_connection()
- ⚠️ Connections not explicitly closed
- ✅ Proper commits after writes

### Async Patterns
- ✅ Proper async/await usage
- ✅ asyncio.gather for parallel operations
- ✅ No blocking operations found

---

## 📋 RECOMMENDATIONS PRIORITY

### High Priority (Fix Soon)
1. ✅ **Notes parameter not working** - Needs command re-sync
2. ⚠️ **Memory leak in pending_verifications** - Add cleanup task
3. ⚠️ **Interaction timeouts** - Add retry logic

### Medium Priority (Fix When Convenient)
1. **Database connections** - Add explicit close()
2. **Screenshot memory usage** - Add size limits or disk storage
3. **Rate limit handling** - Batch role operations

### Low Priority (Nice to Have)
1. **Specific exception handling** - Replace generic Exception
2. **Code splitting** - Break up large files (setup.py, role_connection_ui.py)
3. **Add type hints** - Improve code documentation

---

## ✅ SECURITY AUDIT

### Authentication & Authorization
- ✅ Owner IDs properly configured
- ✅ Permission checks in place (check_mod_permission, check_staff_permission)
- ✅ No hardcoded credentials

### Input Validation
- ✅ File type validation for screenshots
- ⚠️ No file size validation (add 10MB limit)
- ✅ SQL injection protected (using parameterized queries)

### Data Storage
- ✅ SQLite database with proper schema
- ✅ No sensitive data in logs
- ✅ Proper data cleanup (appeals, verifications)

---

## 🎯 CONCLUSION

**Overall Grade: B+**

The codebase is well-structured and functional with good separation of concerns. Recent fixes have addressed critical issues (infinite loops, timeouts). Main areas for improvement are memory management, connection handling, and command synchronization.

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Fix notes parameter (run /sync in Discord)
2. Add cleanup task for pending_verifications
3. Test on droplet to avoid local PC timeout issues

**Long-term Improvements:**
1. Add database connection cleanup
2. Implement rate limit handling
3. Add file size validation
4. Split large files into smaller modules
