# Cheater Role Protection System - Enhanced

## Problem Solved

**Issue:** When a user received the "cheater" role, MalaBoT would remove all their other roles. However, other bots (like role connection bots) would immediately add roles back (e.g., "sus" role when "mala" role was missing), resulting in users having both "cheater" and "sus" roles.

**Root Cause:** The previous `on_member_update` listener only triggered when the cheater role was **initially added**. It didn't monitor for roles being added **after** the cheater role was already present.

## Solution Implemented

### What Changed

Modified the `on_member_update` listener in `cogs/verify.py` to provide **continuous protection**:

**Before:**
```python
# Only checked if cheater role was just added
if not cheater_role or cheater_role not in added_roles:
    return
```

**After:**
```python
# Checks if user currently has cheater role (regardless of when it was added)
if cheater_role in after.roles:
    # Remove ANY other roles that appear
```

### How It Works Now

1. **Continuous Monitoring:** The listener now checks if the user **currently has** the cheater role, not just if it was recently added
2. **Automatic Removal:** Any time a role is added to a user with the cheater role, it's immediately removed
3. **Bot-Proof:** This will continuously fight other bots trying to add roles, keeping only the cheater role active

### Timeline Example

**Old System:**
1. User gets cheater role → MalaBoT removes all roles ✅
2. Other bot adds "sus" role → Nothing happens ❌
3. User ends up with: cheater + sus

**New System:**
1. User gets cheater role → MalaBoT removes all roles ✅
2. Other bot adds "sus" role → MalaBoT immediately removes it ✅
3. User ends up with: cheater only ✅

## Testing Instructions

1. **Pull the latest changes:**
   ```bash
   cd C:\Users\malak\Desktop\Mala
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. **Restart your bot** (on droplet or locally)

3. **Test the protection:**
   - Assign cheater role to a test user
   - Wait for your other bot to try adding the "sus" role
   - Verify that MalaBoT immediately removes it
   - Check logs for: `[CHEATER_ROLE] Removed X roles from username (cheater role protection)`

## Benefits

✅ **Automatic Protection:** No manual intervention needed
✅ **Bot-Proof:** Works against any bot trying to add roles
✅ **Instant Response:** Removes roles as soon as they're added
✅ **Logged Actions:** All removals are logged for transparency
✅ **No Configuration Needed:** Works automatically with existing cheater role setup

## Technical Details

- **File Modified:** `cogs/verify.py` (lines 319-350)
- **Event Listener:** `on_member_update`
- **Trigger:** Any role addition to any member
- **Action:** If member has cheater role, remove all other roles
- **Performance:** Minimal impact - only processes when roles are actually added

## Notes

- The cheater role must be positioned **above** other roles in Discord's role hierarchy for MalaBoT to have permission to remove them
- If MalaBoT lacks permissions, it will log an error but won't crash
- This system works alongside your existing verification and appeal systems
