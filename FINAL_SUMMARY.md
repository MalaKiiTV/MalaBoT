# XP System Fixes - Final Summary

## ✅ All Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ XP Range System Removed
**Problem**: XP was randomly awarded between 5-15 per message
**Solution**: 
- Replaced with fixed amounts: Message (10), Reaction (2), Voice (5)
- All amounts configurable per-guild via `/setup`
- Updated `config/constants.py` to remove `XP_PER_MESSAGE_MIN/MAX`
- Added `XP_PER_MESSAGE`, `XP_PER_REACTION`, `XP_PER_VOICE_MINUTE`

### 2. ✅ Reaction XP Added
**Problem**: No way to reward users for quality content
**Solution**:
- Added `on_reaction_add` listener in `cogs/xp.py`
- Users gain XP when their messages receive reactions
- Configurable amount (default: 2 XP per reaction)
- Can be disabled by setting to 0

### 3. ✅ Voice XP Added
**Problem**: No XP for voice chat participation
**Solution**:
- Added `on_voice_state_update` listener in `cogs/xp.py`
- Users gain XP when leaving voice channels
- Configurable amount (default: 5 XP per minute)
- Can be disabled by setting to 0

### 4. ✅ Channel Selection Working
**Problem**: User reported channel selection not working
**Solution**:
- Verified channel selection already working correctly
- Defer properly placed in all callbacks
- Channels saved with guild-specific keys

### 5. ✅ Level Roles Display Added
**Problem**: Config view didn't show level roles
**Solution**:
- Added level roles count to `/setup` → "View Current Config"
- Shows "Level Roles: X configured"
- Existing `/xplevelrole` command already functional

### 6. ✅ Roast XP System Verified
**Problem**: User wanted similar roast XP for bot level-ups
**Solution**:
- Roast XP system already exists and working!
- Bot gains 5-15 XP when users roast it
- Bot has 10 levels with titles (Newbie Roaster → Roast God)
- Level and title displayed in roast responses
