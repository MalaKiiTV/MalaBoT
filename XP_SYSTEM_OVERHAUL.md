# XP System Overhaul - Complete Documentation

## Overview
This update completely overhauls the XP system to use **fixed XP amounts** instead of random ranges, adds **reaction and voice XP tracking**, and improves the configuration display.

---

## üéØ Major Changes

### 1. **Fixed XP Amounts (No More Ranges)**

#### Before:
- XP was randomly awarded between 5-15 per message
- Unpredictable and inconsistent progression
- Users couldn't plan their leveling

#### After:
- **Message XP**: Fixed amount (default: 10 XP)
- **Reaction XP**: Fixed amount (default: 2 XP per reaction received)
- **Voice XP**: Fixed amount (default: 5 XP per minute in voice)
- All amounts are configurable per server via `/setup`

### 2. **New XP Sources**

#### Reaction XP
- Users gain XP when their messages receive reactions
- Configurable amount (set to 0 to disable)
- Encourages quality content creation
- Example: User posts a helpful message ‚Üí Gets 5 reactions ‚Üí Gains 10 XP (2 per reaction)

#### Voice XP
- Users gain XP for participating in voice channels
- Currently awards XP when leaving voice (simplified implementation)
- Configurable amount (set to 0 to disable)
- Future enhancement: Track time spent and award periodically

### 3. **Improved Configuration Display**

The `/setup` ‚Üí "View Current Config" now shows:
- Level-up Channel
- Message XP amount
- Reaction XP amount
- Voice XP amount
- XP Cooldown
- **Level Roles count** (NEW!)

## üèÜ Level Role Rewards

### Managing Level Roles

Use the `/xplevelrole` command to manage role rewards:

#### Add a Level Role
```
/xplevelrole action:Add level:10 role:@Level 10
```
- Users will automatically receive this role when reaching level 10

#### Remove a Level Role
```
/xplevelrole action:Remove level:10
```
- Removes the role reward for level 10

#### List All Level Roles
```
/xplevelrole action:List
```
- Shows all configured level roles

### How Level Roles Work
1. User gains enough XP to level up
2. Bot checks if there's a role configured for that level
3. If yes, bot automatically assigns the role
4. Role is permanent (doesn't get removed if user loses XP)

---

## üî• Roast XP System

The bot has its own leveling system based on roasts!

### How It Works
1. Users roast the bot using `/roast` (without target)
2. Bot gains 5-15 Roast XP per roast
3. Bot levels up and gains new titles
4. Bot's responses get sassier as it levels up

### Roast Titles
- Level 1: Newbie Roaster
- Level 2: Sassy Bot
- Level 3: Sharp Tongue
- Level 4: Burn Master
- Level 5: Fire Brand
- Level 6: Inferno Speaker
- Level 7: Dragon's Breath
- Level 8: Hellfire Roaster
- Level 9: Legendary Burn
- Level 10: Roast God

### Viewing Bot's Roast Level
- The bot's current level and title are shown in roast responses
- Example: "+12 Roast XP ‚Ä¢ Fire Brand"

## üìä Technical Details

### Database Settings Format
All XP settings are stored per-guild:
- `xp_per_message_{guild_id}` - Message XP amount
- `xp_per_reaction_{guild_id}` - Reaction XP amount
- `xp_per_voice_minute_{guild_id}` - Voice XP amount
- `xp_cooldown_{guild_id}` - Cooldown in seconds
- `xp_channel_{guild_id}` - Level-up channel ID
- `xp_levelup_message_{guild_id}` - Custom level-up message
- `xp_level_roles_{guild_id}` - Level role rewards (format: "level:role_id,level:role_id")

### Default Values
If not configured, the system uses these defaults:
- Message XP: 10
- Reaction XP: 2
- Voice XP: 5
- Cooldown: 60 seconds

### XP Calculation
- **Messages**: Fixed amount per message (respects cooldown)
- **Reactions**: Fixed amount per reaction received (no cooldown)
- **Voice**: Fixed amount when leaving voice channel (simplified)

### Level Calculation
Levels are calculated using the XP_TABLE in `config/constants.py`:
- Level 1: 0 XP
- Level 2: 100 XP
- Level 3: 250 XP
- Level 5: 700 XP
- Level 10: 3,200 XP
- Level 20: 20,000 XP

2. Wait 5 minutes
3. Restart Discord client
4. Try again

### Level Roles Not Being Assigned

## üìù Notes

- **Reaction XP**: Awarded to message author, not the reactor
- **Voice XP**: Currently simplified (awards on leave), can be enhanced later
