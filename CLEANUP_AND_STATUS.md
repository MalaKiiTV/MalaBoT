## üîß Next Steps

### For You to Do:
1. **Pull the latest changes** from GitHub:
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. **Restart your bot** to load the fixed verify.py:
   ```bash
   # Stop the bot if running
   # Then start it again
   python bot.py
   ```

3. **Test the verification system**:
   - Try `/verify review` command
   - Check if it loads without errors
   - Test the cheater role assignment

### Debug Logging (Optional)
If you still want debug logging to troubleshoot the cheater role issue, I recommend:
1. Adding simple print statements manually in the verify.py file
2. Focus on the cheater section only (lines 215-255)
3. Add one print statement at a time and test

### Cheater Role Issue Investigation
To investigate why the cheater role isn't being assigned:
1. Check the database to confirm cheater_role_id and cheater_jail_channel_id are set
2. Verify the role and channel exist in Discord
3. Check bot permissions (Manage Roles, Manage Channels)
4. Ensure the bot's role is higher than the cheater role in the role hierarchy

## üìä Repository Statistics

### Total Files: ~30 Python/Config files
### Documentation: 10 essential guides
